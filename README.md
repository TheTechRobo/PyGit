# pyGit
A small module for running Git operations...

Documentation and details are in the [wiki](https://github.com/thetechrobo/pygit/wiki).

# Installing from PyPI
pyGit is on PyPI with the name `pyyGit` (due to another project with the name pyGit). However, you still need to use `import pygit` or `from pygit import *` instead of `import pyygit` or `from pyygit import *`. Because the *package name* is pyGit but the PyPI name is pyyGit.
